Feature Detection
=================

One very common task in mass spectrometry is the detection of 2-dimensional
patterns in m/z and time (RT) dimension from a series of MS1 scans. These
patterns are called ``Features`` and they exhibit a chromatographic elution
profile in the time dimension and an isotopic pattern in the m/z dimension (see 
`previous section <deisotoping.html>`_ for the 1-dimensional problem).
OpenMS has multiple tools that can identify these features in 2-dimensional
data, these tools are called `FeatureFinder`.  Currently the following
FeatureFinders are available in pyOpenMS:

  - FeatureFinderMultiplexAlgorithm (e.g., SILAC, Dimethyl labeling, (and label-free), identification free feature detection of peptides)
  - FeatureFinderAlgorithmPicked (Label-free, identification free feature detection of peptides)
  - FeatureFinderIdentificationAlgorithm (Label-free identification-guided feature detection of peptides)
  - FeatureFinderAlgorithmIsotopeWavelet (old instruments)
  - FeatureFindingMetabo (Label-free, identification free feature detection of metabolites)
  - FeatureFinderAlgorithmMetaboIdent (Label-free, identification guided feature detection of metabolites)

All of the algorithms above are for proteomics data with the exception of FeatureFindingMetabo and FeatureFinderMetaboIdent for metabolomics data and small molecules in general. 

Proteomics
**********

Two of the most commonly used FeatureFinders for proteomics in OpenMS are the FeatureFinder and FeatureFinderIdentificationAlgorithm which both work on (high
resolution) centroided data. We can use the following code to find ``Features`` in MS data:

.. code-block:: python

  from urllib.request import urlretrieve

  gh = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenMS/pyopenms-docs/master"
  urlretrieve(
      gh + "/src/data/FeatureFinderCentroided_1_input.mzML", "feature_test.mzML"
  )

  from pyopenms import *

  # Prepare data loading (save memory by only
  # loading MS1 spectra into memory)
  options = PeakFileOptions()
  options.setMSLevels([1])
  fh = MzMLFile()
  fh.setOptions(options)

  # Load data
  input_map = MSExperiment()
  fh.load("feature_test.mzML", input_map)
  input_map.updateRanges()

  ff = FeatureFinder()
  ff.setLogType(LogType.CMD)

  # Run the feature finder
  name = "centroided"
  features = FeatureMap()
  seeds = FeatureMap()
  params = FeatureFinder().getParameters(name)
  ff.run(name, input_map, features, params, seeds)

  features.setUniqueIds()
  fh = FeatureXMLFile()
  fh.store("output.featureXML", features)
  print("Found", features.size(), "features")

With a few lines of Python, we are able to run powerful algorithms available in
OpenMS. The resulting data is held in memory (a ``FeatureMap`` object) and can be
inspected directly using the ``help(features)`` comment. It reveals that the
object supports iteration (through the ``__iter__`` function) as well as direct
access (through the ``__getitem__`` function). This means we write code that uses direct access and iteration in
Python as follows:

.. code-block:: python

  f0 = features[0]
  for f in features:
      print(f.getRT(), f.getMZ())


Each entry in the ``FeatureMap`` is a so-called ``Feature`` and allows direct
access to the `m/z` and `RT` value from Python. Again, we can lear this by
inspecting ``help(f)`` or by consulting the Manual.

Note: the output file that we have written (``output.featureXML``) is an
OpenMS-internal XML format for storing features. You can learn more about file
formats in the `Reading MS data formats <other_file_handling.html>`_ section.

Metabolomics - untargeted
*************************

For the untargeted detection of small molecule features we can use the ``FeatureFindingMetabo`` with prior ``MassTraceDetection`` and ``ElutionPeakDetection``.

.. code-block:: python

  from pyopenms import *
  from urllib.request import urlretrieve

  gh = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenMS/pyopenms-docs/master"
  mzML_path = gh + "/src/data/FeatureFinderMetaboIdent_1_input.mzML"
  urlretrieve(mzML_path, "ms_data.mzML")

  exp = MSExperiment()
  MzMLFile().load("ms_data.mzML", exp)

  exp.sortSpectra(True)

  mass_traces = []
  mtd = MassTraceDetection()
  mtd_params = mtd.getDefaults()
  mtd_params.setValue(
      "mass_error_ppm", 5.0
  )  # set according to your instrument mass error
  mtd_params.setValue(
      "noise_threshold_int", 3000.0
  )  # adjust to noise level in your data
  mtd.setParameters(mtd_params)
  mtd.run(exp, mass_traces, 0)

  mass_traces_split = []
  mass_traces_final = []
  epd = ElutionPeakDetection()
  epd_params = epd.getDefaults()
  epd_params.setValue("width_filtering", "fixed")
  epd.setParameters(epd_params)
  epd.detectPeaks(mass_traces, mass_traces_split)

  if epd.getParameters().getValue("width_filtering") == "auto":
      epd.filterByPeakWidth(mass_traces_split, mass_traces_final)
  else:
      mass_traces_final = mass_traces_split

  fm = FeatureMap()
  feat_chrom = []
  ffm = FeatureFindingMetabo()
  ffm_params = ffm.getDefaults()
  ffm_params.setValue("isotope_filtering_model", "none")
  ffm_params.setValue(
      "remove_single_traces", "true"
  )  # set false to keep features with only one mass trace
  ffm_params.setValue("mz_scoring_by_elements", "false")
  ffm_params.setValue("report_convex_hulls", "true")
  ffm.setParameters(ffm_params)
  ffm.run(mass_traces_final, fm, feat_chrom)

  fm.setUniqueIds()
  fm.setPrimaryMSRunPath(["ms_data.mzML".encode()])

Metabolomics - targeted
***********************

``FeatureFinderAlgorithmMetaboIdent`` performs MS1-based **targeted feature extraction** based on user provided compounds, which are 
specified in an assay library (a tab-separated text file). Detected ``Features`` are stored in a ``FeatureMap`` which can be 
stored in a ``FeatureXMLFile``. This tool is useful for the targeted extraction of ``Features`` for a well defined set of compounds 
with known sum formulas and retention times. 
For more information on the format of the assay library and available parameters visit the `FeatureFinderMetaboIdent documentation
<https://abibuilder.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/archive/openms/Documentation/release/latest/html/UTILS_FeatureFinderMetaboIdent.html>`_.


The pyOpenMS ``FeatureFinderAlgorithmMetaboIdent`` needs a list of ``FeatureFinderMetaboIdentCompound`` objects as an assay libray for it's
``run`` function. We could create that list ourselves or use the following function to read an assay library as ``.tsv`` file:

.. csv-table:: Coupounds tsv file
   :widths: 50 30 15 15 15 15 15 
   :header: "CompoundName", "SumFormula", "Mass", "Charge", "RetentionTime", "RetentionTimeRange", "IsoDistribution"

   "2'-O-methylcytidine", "C10H15N3O5",0,1,207.6,0,0
   "5-formylcytidine", "C10O6N3H13",0,1,269.4,0,0
   "5-methyluridine", "C10H14N2O6",0,1,291.6,0,0
   "adenosine","C10H13N5O4",0,1,220.8,0,0
   "deoxyadenosine","C10H13N5O3",0,1,243.0,0,0
   "inosine","C10H12N4O5",0,1,264.0,0,0

.. code-block:: python

  import csv

  # read tsv file and create list of FeatureFinderMetaboIdentCompound
  def metaboTableFromFile(path_to_library_file):
      metaboTable = []
      with open(path_to_library_file, "r") as tsv_file:
          tsv_reader = csv.reader(tsv_file, delimiter="\t")
          next(tsv_reader)  # skip header
          for row in tsv_reader:
              metaboTable.append(
                  FeatureFinderMetaboIdentCompound(
                      row[0],  # name
                      row[1],  # sum formula
                      float(row[2]),  # mass
                      [int(charge) for charge in row[3].split(",")],  # charges
                      [float(rt) for rt in row[4].split(",")],  # RTs
                      [
                          float(rt_range) for rt_range in row[5].split(",")
                      ],  # RT ranges
                      [
                          float(iso_distrib) for iso_distrib in row[6].split(",")
                      ],  # isotope distributions
                  )
              )
      return metaboTable

Now we can use the following code to detect features with ``FeatureFinderAlgorithmMetaboIdent`` and store them in a ``FeatureXMLFile``:

.. code-block:: python

  from urllib.request import urlretrieve
  from pyopenms import *

  gh = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenMS/pyopenms-docs/master"
  mzML_path = gh + "/src/data/FeatureFinderMetaboIdent_1_input.mzML"
  urlretrieve(mzML_path, "ms_data.mzML")
  urlretrieve(
      gh + "/src/data/FeatureFinderMetaboIdent_1_input.tsv", "library.tsv"
  )

  # load ms data from mzML file into MSExperiment
  spectra = MSExperiment()
  MzMLFile().load("ms_data.mzML", spectra)

  # create FeatureFinderAlgorithmMetaboIdent and assign ms data
  ff = FeatureFinderAlgorithmMetaboIdent()
  ff.setMSData(spectra)

  # read library generate a metabo table with compounds
  metabo_table = metaboTableFromFile("library.tsv")

  # FeatureMap to store results
  fm = FeatureMap()

  # edit some parameters
  params = ff.getParameters()
  params[b"extract:mz_window"] = 5.0  # 5 ppm
  params[b"extract:rt_window"] = 20.0  # 20 seconds
  params[b"detect:peak_width"] = 3.0  # 3 seconds
  ff.setParameters(params)

  # run the FeatureFinderMetaboIdent with the metabo_table and mzML file path -> store results in fm
  ff.run(metabo_table, fm, mzML_path)

  # save FeatureMap to file
  FeatureXMLFile().store("detected_features.featureXML", fm)

Note: the output file that we have written (``output.featureXML``) is an
OpenMS-internal XML format for storing features. You can learn more about file
formats in the `Reading MS data formats <other_file_handling.html>`_ section.

We can get a quick overview on the detected features by plotting them using the following function:

.. code-block:: python

  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


  def plotDetectedFeatures3D(path_to_featureXML):
      fm = FeatureMap()
      fh = FeatureXMLFile()
      fh.load(path_to_featureXML, fm)

      fig = plt.figure()
      ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection="3d")

      for feature in fm:
          color = next(ax._get_lines.prop_cycler)["color"]
          # chromatogram data is stored in the subordinates of the feature
          for i, sub in enumerate(feature.getSubordinates()):
              retention_times = [
                  x[0] for x in sub.getConvexHulls()[0].getHullPoints()
              ]
              intensities = [
                  int(y[1]) for y in sub.getConvexHulls()[0].getHullPoints()
              ]
              mz = sub.getMetaValue("MZ")
              ax.plot(retention_times, intensities, zs=mz, zdir="x", color=color)
              if i == 0:
                  ax.text(
                      mz,
                      retention_times[0],
                      max(intensities) * 1.02,
                      feature.getMetaValue("label"),
                      color=color,
                  )

      ax.set_ylabel("time (s)")
      ax.set_xlabel("m/z")
      ax.set_zlabel("intensity (cps)")
      plt.show()
