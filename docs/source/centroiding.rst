Centroiding 
===========

MS instruments typically allow storing spectra in profile mode (several data points per m/z peak)
or in the more codensed centroid mode (one data point per m/z peak). The process of converting
a profile spectrum into a centroided one is called peak centroiding or peak picking.

Note: The term peak picking is ambiguous as it is also used for feature detection (i.e. 3D "peak" finding).

First, we load some profile data:

.. code-block:: python

    from urllib.request import urlretrieve
    from pyopenms import *
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    gh = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenMS/pyopenms-docs/master"
    urlretrieve (gh +"/src/data/PeakPickerHiRes_input.mzML", "tutorial.mzML")

    profile_spectra = MSExperiment()
    MzMLFile().load("tutorial.mzML", profile_spectra) 

Let's zoom in on an isotopic pattern in profile mode and plot it.

.. code-block:: python

    plt.xlim(771.8, 774) # zoom into isotopic pattern
    plt.plot(profile_spectra[0].get_peaks()[0], profile_spectra[0].get_peaks()[1]) # plot the first spectrum

.. image:: img/profile_data.png

Because of the limited resolution of MS instruments m/z measurements are not of unlimited precision. 
Consequently, peak shapes spreads in the m/z dimension and resemble a gaussian distribution.
Using the PeakPickerHiRes algorithm, we can convert data from profile to centroided mode. Usually, not much information is lost
by storing only centroided data. Thus, many algorithms and tools assume that centroided data is provided.

.. code-block:: python

    centroided_spectra = MSExperiment()

    # input, output, chec_spectrum_type (if set, checks spectrum type and throws an exception if a centroided spectrum is passed)
    PeakPickerHiRes().pickExperiment(profile_spectra, centroided_spectra, True) # pick all spectra
    
    plt.xlim(771.8,774) # zoom into isotopic pattern
    plt.stem(centroided_spectra[0].get_peaks()[0], centroided_spectra[0].get_peaks()[1]) # plot as vertical lines
    
.. image:: img/centroided_data.png

After centroding, a single m/z value for every isotopic peak is retained. By plotting the centroided data as stem plot
we discover that (in addition to the isotopic peaks) some low intensity peaks (intensity at approx. 4k) were present in the profile data.
