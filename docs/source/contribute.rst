Contribution to the pyOpenMS documentation is easy and we would
love to expand it with you.
Just change (or add new) .rst files and open a pull request.
If you are unsure how to do that or want to discuss questions 
(e.g. your example workflow can be included on this webpage) contact us via the 
`OpenMS Gitter chat channel <https://gitter.im/OpenMS/OpenMS/>`_.
