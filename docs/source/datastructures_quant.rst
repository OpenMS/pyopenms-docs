Quantitative Data
=================

Feature
*******

In OpenMS, information about quantitative data is stored in a so-called
``Feature`` which we have previously discussed `here
<other_file_handling.html#quantiative-data-featurexml-consensusxml>`_.  Each
``Feature`` represents a region in RT and *m/z* space use for quantitative
analysis.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    from pyopenms import *
    feature = Feature()
    feature.setMZ( 500.9 )
    feature.setCharge(2)
    feature.setRT( 1500.1 )
    feature.setIntensity( 30500 )
    feature.setOverallQuality( 10 )
..    py 2.4
      masstrace = []
      for i in range(10):
        p = DPosition2(feature.getRT() + i - 5, 200 - abs(i-5))
        masstrace.push_back(p)

Usually, the quantitative features would be produced by a so-called
"FeatureFinder" algorithm, which we will discuss in the next chapter. The
features can be stored in a ``FeatureMap`` and written to disk.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    fm = FeatureMap()
    fm.push_back(feature)
    feature.setRT(1600.5 )
    feature.setCharge(2)
    feature.setMZ( 600.0 )
    feature.setIntensity( 80500.0 )
    fm.push_back(feature)
    FeatureXMLFile().store("test.featureXML", fm)

Visualizing the resulting map in ``TOPPView`` allows detection of the two
features stored in the ``FeatureMap`` with the visualization indicating charge
state, *m/z*, RT and other properties:

.. image:: img/feature.png

Note that in this case only 2 features are present, but in a typical LC-MS/MS
experiments, thousands of features are present.


FeatureMap
************

The resulting ``FeatureMap`` can be used in various ways to extract
quantitative data directly and it supports direct iteration in Python:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    fmap = FeatureMap()
    FeatureXMLFile().load("test.featureXML", fmap)
    for feature in fmap:
       print("Feature: ", feature.getIntensity(), feature.getRT(), feature.getMZ())



ConsensusFeature
****************

Often LC-MS/MS experiments are run to compare quantitative features across
experiments. In OpenMS, linked features from individual experiments are
represented by a ``ConsensusFeature``

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    feature = ConsensusFeature()
    feature.setMZ( 500.9 )
    feature.setCharge(2)
    feature.setRT( 1500.1 )
    feature.setIntensity( 80500 )

    # Generate ConsensusFeature and features from two maps (with id 1 and 2)
    ### Feature 1
    f_m1 = ConsensusFeature()
    f_m1.setRT(500)
    f_m1.setMZ(300.01)
    f_m1.setIntensity(200)
    f_m1.ensureUniqueId()
    ### Feature 2
    f_m2 = ConsensusFeature()
    f_m2.setRT(505)
    f_m2.setMZ(299.99)
    f_m2.setIntensity(600)
    f_m2.ensureUniqueId()
    feature.insert(1, f_m1 )
    feature.insert(2, f_m2 )

We have thus added two features from two individual maps (which have the unique
identifier ``1`` and ``2``) to the ``ConsensusFeature``.
Next, we inspect the consensus feature, compute a "consensus" *m/z* across
the two maps and output the two linked features:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    # The two features in map 1 and map 2 represent the same analyte at
    # slightly different RT and m/z
    for fh in feature.getFeatureList():
      print(fh.getMapIndex(), fh.getIntensity(), fh.getRT())

    print(feature.getMZ())
    feature.computeMonoisotopicConsensus()
    print(feature.getMZ())

    # Generate ConsensusMap and add two maps (with id 1 and 2)
    cmap = ConsensusMap()
    fds = { 1 : ColumnHeader(), 2 : ColumnHeader() }
    fds[1].filename = "file1"
    fds[2].filename = "file2"
    cmap.setColumnHeaders(fds)

    feature.ensureUniqueId()
    cmap.push_back(feature)
    ConsensusXMLFile().store("test.consensusXML", cmap)

Inspection of the generated ``test.consensusXML`` reveals that it contains
references to two LC-MS/MS runs (``file1`` and ``file2``) with their respective
unique identifier. Note how the two features we added before have matching
unique identifiers.  

Visualization of the resulting output file reveals a single
``ConsensusFeature`` of size 2 that links to the two individual features at
their respective positions in RT and *m/z*:

ConsensusMap
************

The resulting ``ConsensusMap`` can be used in various ways to extract
quantitative data directly and it supports direct iteration in Python:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    cmap = ConsensusMap()
    ConsensusXMLFile().load("test.consensusXML", cmap)
    for cfeature in cmap:
       cfeature.computeConsensus()
       print("ConsensusFeature", cfeature.getIntensity(), cfeature.getRT(), cfeature.getMZ())
       # The two features in map 1 and map 2 represent the same analyte at
       # slightly different RT and m/z
       for fh in cfeature.getFeatureList():
         print(" -- Feature", fh.getMapIndex(), fh.getIntensity(), fh.getRT())
