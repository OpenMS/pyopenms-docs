TheoreticalSpectrumGenerator
============================

This class implements a simple generator which generates tandem MS spectra from
a given peptide charge combination. There are various options which influence
the occurring ions and their intensities.

Y-ion spectrum
**************

First, we will generate a simple spectrum that only contains y ions

.. code-block:: python

    from pyopenms import *

    tsg = TheoreticalSpectrumGenerator()
    spec1 = MSSpectrum()
    peptide = AASequence.fromString("DFPIANGER")
    # standard behavior is adding b- and y-ions of charge 1
    p = Param()
    p.setValue("add_b_ions", "false")
    p.setValue("add_metainfo", "true")
    tsg.setParameters(p)
    tsg.getSpectrum(spec1, peptide, 1, 1)

    # Iterate over annotated ions and their masses
    print("Spectrum 1 of", peptide, "has", spec1.size(), "peaks.")
    for ion, peak in zip(spec1.getStringDataArrays()[0], spec1):
        print(ion.decode(), "is generated at m/z", peak.getMZ())

which produces all y single charged ions:

.. code-block:: python

    Spectrum 1 of DFPIANGER has 8 peaks.
    y1+ is generated at m/z 175.118952913371
    y2+ is generated at m/z 304.161547136671
    y3+ is generated at m/z 361.18301123237103
    y4+ is generated at m/z 475.225939423771
    y5+ is generated at m/z 546.2630535832709
    y6+ is generated at m/z 659.3471179341709
    y7+ is generated at m/z 756.3998821574709
    y8+ is generated at m/z 903.4682964445709


Full fragment ion spectrum
**************************

We can also produce additional peaks in the fragment ion spectrum, such as
isotopic peaks, higher charge states, additional ion series or common neutral
losses:

.. code-block:: python

    spec2 = MSSpectrum()
    p.setValue("add_b_ions", "true")
    p.setValue("add_a_ions", "true")
    p.setValue("add_losses", "true")
    p.setValue("add_metainfo", "true")
    tsg.setParameters(p)
    tsg.getSpectrum(spec2, peptide, 1, 2)

    # Iterate over annotated ions and their masses
    print("Spectrum 2 of", peptide, "has", spec2.size(), "peaks.")
    for ion, peak in zip(spec2.getStringDataArrays()[0], spec2):
        print(ion.decode(), "is generated at m/z", peak.getMZ())

    exp = MSExperiment()
    exp.addSpectrum(spec1)
    exp.addSpectrum(spec2)
    MzMLFile().store("DFPIANGER.mzML", exp)

which outputs all 146 peaks that are generated (this is without isotopic
peaks), here we will just show the first few peaks:

.. code-block:: python

        Spectrum 2 of DFPIANGER has 146 peaks.
        y1-C1H2N1O1++ is generated at m/z 66.05629515817103
        y1-C1H2N2++ is generated at m/z 67.05221565817102
        y1-H3N1++ is generated at m/z 79.54984014222102
        y1++ is generated at m/z 88.06311469007102
        a2-H2O1++ is generated at m/z 109.05221565817101
        a2++ is generated at m/z 118.05749819007102
        b2-H2O1++ is generated at m/z 123.049673158171
        y2-C1H2N1O1++ is generated at m/z 130.57759226982103
        y1-C1H2N1O1+ is generated at m/z 131.10531384957102
        y2-C1H2N2++ is generated at m/z 131.573512769821
        b2++ is generated at m/z 132.054955690071
        y1-C1H2N2+ is generated at m/z 133.097154849571
        y2-H2O1++ is generated at m/z 143.579129269821
        y2-H3N1++ is generated at m/z 144.07113725387103
        y2++ is generated at m/z 152.58441180172102
        [...]

The first example shows how to put peaks of a certain type, y-ions in this case, into
a spectrum. The second spectrum is filled with a complete fragment ion spectrum
of all peaks (a-, b-, y-ions and losses). The losses are based on commonly
observed fragment ion losses for specific amino acids and are defined in the
``Residues.xml`` file, which means that not all fragment ions will produce all
possible losses, as can be observed above: water loss is not observed for the
y1 ion but for the y2 ion since glutamic acid can have a neutral water loss but
arginine cannot. Similarly, only water loss and no ammonia loss is simulated in
the ``a/b/c`` ion series with the first fragment capable of ammonia loss being
asparagine at position 6.


The ``TheoreticalSpectrumGenerator``
has many parameters which have a detailed description located in the class
documentation. Note how the ``add_metainfo`` parameter 
populates the ``StringDataArray`` of the output spectrum, allowing us to
iterate over annotated ions and their masses.

Visualization
*************

We can now visualize the resulting spectra using TOPPView when we open the
DFPIANGER.mzML file that we produced above in TOPPView:

.. image:: img/peptide_y_ions.png

We can see all eight y ion peaks that are produced in the
TheoreticalSpectrumGenerator and when we hover over one of the peaks (546 mz in
this example) there is an annotation in the bottom left corner that indicates
charge state and ion name (``y5+`` for every peak). The larger spectrum with
146 peaks can also be interactively investigated with TOPPView (the second
spectrum in the file):

.. image:: img/peptide_all_ions.png

There are substantially more peaks here and the spectrum is much busier, with
singly and double charged peaks of the b, y and a series creating 44 different
individual fragment ion peaks as well as neutral losses adding an additional
102 peaks (neutral losses easily recognizable by their 10-fold lower intensity
in the simulated spectrum).
