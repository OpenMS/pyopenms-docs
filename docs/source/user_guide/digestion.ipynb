    "# Digestion\n",
    "\n",
    "In `top-down proteomics`, whole proteins are measured in the mass spec.\n",
    "It is a hard problem to know the exact protein sequence, since proteins\n",
    "can be very large, i.e. have a very long sequence of constituing amino\n",
    "acids.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in an orthogonal approach called `bottom-up proteomics`, it is\n",
    "usually more beneficial to first cut proteins into smaller chunks at\n",
    "defined positions by using enzymatic digestion. The resulting peptides\n",
    "are lighter in mass, have less charge, and their sequence can be readily\n",
    "determined using MS/MS in many cases. In a subsequent step, one needs to\n",
    "infer which proteins were present in the sample, given a set of peptide\n",
    "sequences - a process called protein inference. The usual enzyme of\n",
    "choice for bottom-up proteomics is `Trypsin` (sometimes in combination\n",
    "with Lys-C).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now learn how to do digestion of protein sequences in-silico, so\n",
    "you can predict which peptides you can expect to observe in the data and\n",
    "even generate theoretical spectra for them.\n",

    "## Overview of the tool\n",

    "Proteolytic digestion can be performed through class `ProteaseDigestion`\n",
    "and its method `.digest`. This method has two variants. Simple variant:\n",

    "#   protein - Sequence of the protein to be digested. (pyopenms.AASequence)\n",
    "#   output - Empty list. This is where produced peptides will be stored. Warning: if the list is not empty, all its contents will be deleted! (list)\n",
    "#\n",
    "#   -> returns number of peptides which did not meet length restrictions and were discarded. (int)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The other variant allows you to specify minimum and maximum length of\n",
    "peptides produced:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` cython\n",
    "digest(protein : pyopenms.AASequence, output : list, min_length : int, max_length : int) -> int\n",

    "#   output - Empty list. This is where produced peptides will be stored. Warning: if the list is not empty, all its contents will be deleted! (list)\n",
    "#   min_length - Minimum length of produced peptide. Shorter products will be discarded. (int)\n",
