    C18
        Octadecyl (C18) is an alkyl radical C(18)H(37) derived from an octadecane by removal of one hydrogen atom.

    CID
    collision-induced dissociation
        Collision-induced dissociation is an MS technique to induce fragmentation of selected ions in the gas phase,
        which are subjected to a subsequent measurement (see :term:`MS2`).

    consensus features
    consensus feature
        Features from replicate experiments with similar retention times and m/z values are linked and considered a consensus feature.
        A consensus feature contains information on the common retention time and m/z values as well as intensities for each sample.
        OpenMS represents a consensus feature using the class `ConsensusFeature
        <https://abibuilder.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/archive/openms/Documentation/nightly/html/classOpenMS_1_1ConsensusFeature.html>`_.

    consensus maps
    consensus map
        A consensus map is a collection of :term:`consensus features` identified from mass spectra across replicate experiments,
        usually by combining multiple :term:`feature maps`.
        One consensus map usually contains many consensus features. OpenMS represents a consensus map using 
        the class `ConsensusMap <https://abibuilder.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/archive/openms/Documentation/nightly/html/classOpenMS_1_1ConsensusMap.html>`_.

    de novo peptide sequencing
        A peptide's amino acid sequence is inferred directly from the precursor peptide mass and tandem
        mass spectrum (:term:`MS2` or :term:`MS3`) fragment ions, without comparison to a reference proteome.

    electrospray ionization
    ESI
        Electrospray ionization (ESI) is a technique used in MS to produce ions.
        ESI usually gives rise to peptides of charge 2 or higher.
        ESI is usually coupled to Orbitrap and FTICR instruments.

    FASTA
        A text-based file format for representing nucleotide or amino acid sequences.

    feature
    features
        A feature, in the OpenMS terminology, subsumes all m/z signals originating from a single compound at a 
        certain charge state. This includes the isotope pattern and usually spans multiple spectra in retention time (the elution profile).

    feature maps
    feature map
        A feature map is a collection of :term:`feature`\ s identified from a single experiment.
        One feature map usually contains many features. OpenMS represents a feature map using the class
        `FeatureMap <https://abibuilder.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/archive/openms/Documentation/nightly/html/classOpenMS_1_1FeatureMap.html>`_.

    high performance liquid chromatography
    HPLC
        In high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), analytes are dissolved in a pressurized solvent (mobile phase)
        and pumped through a solid adsorbent material (stationary phase) packed into a
        capillary column. Physicochemical properties of the analyte determine how strongly it
        interacts with the stationary phase.

    iTRAQ
        Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) is a MS based multiplexing technique designed to
        identify and quantify proteins from different samples in one single measurement.

    MALDI
        matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) is an ionization technique that uses a laser energy-absorbing matrix to create ions.
        ESI usually gives rise to peptides of charge 1.
        MALDI is usually employed in combination with TOF instruments. 
    
    Mass Spectrometry
    MS
        An analytical technique to measure the mass over charge (m/z) ratio of ions along with their abundance. 
        This gives rise to a mass spectrum (with m/z on the x-axis and abundance on the y-axis).

    mass spectra
    mass spectrum
        A visual or numerical representation of a measurement from an MS instrument.
        A spectrum contains (usually many) pairs of mass-over-charge(m/z)+intensity values.
