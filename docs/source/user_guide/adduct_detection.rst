Adduct Detection
================

In mass spectrometry it is crucial to ionize analytes prior to detection, because they are accelerated and manipulated in electric fields, allowing their separation based on mass-to-charge ratio.
This happens by addition of protons in positive mode or loss of protons in negative mode. Other ions present in the buffer solution can ionize the analyte as well, e.g. sodium, potassium or formic acid.
Depending on the size and chemical compsition, multiple adducts can bind leading to multiple charges on the analyte. In metabolomics with smaller analytes the number of charges is typically low with one or two, whereas in proteomics the number of charges is much higher.
Furthermore, analytes can loose functional groups during ionization, e.g. a neutral water loss.
Since the ionization happens after liquid chromatography, different adducts for an analyte have similar retention times.

In pyOpenMS, :py:class:`~.MetaboliteFeatureDeconvolution` takes a :term:`feature map` as input adding adduct information as additional meta values. Features belonging to an adduct group will be stored in a :term:`consensus map`. The most important parameters are explained in the comments.

| **Input file generation:**
| The input :term:`feature map` can be obtained using a `feature finder algorithm <feature_detection.html>`_.

| **Suggested follow up step:**
| The resulting feature map can be exported to a pandas DataFrame with adduct information from the *dc_charge_adducts* feature meta values.
| Multiple feature maps can be `combined using the feature linking algorithms <feature_linking.html>`_. Each consensus feature will get a new meta value *best ion* based on the most common annotated adduct within the consensus feature group.
