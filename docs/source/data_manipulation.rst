Simple Data Manipulation
=========================

Here we will look at a few simple data manipulation techniques on spectral
data, such as filtering. First we will download some sample data.


.. code-block:: python

    from urllib.request import urlretrieve
    gh = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenMS/pyopenms-extra/master"
    urlretrieve (gh + "/src/data/tiny.mzML", "test.mzML")


Filtering Spectra
*******************

We will filter the "test.mzML" file by only retaining spectra that match a
certain identifier

.. code-block:: python
  :linenos:

  from pyopenms import *
  inp = MSExperiment()
  MzMLFile().load("test.mzML", inp)

  e = MSExperiment()
  for s in inp:
    if s.getNativeID().startswith("scan="):
      e.addSpectrum(s)

  MzMLFile().store("test_filtered.mzML", e)


Filtering by MS level
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Similarly, we can filter the ``test.mzML`` file by MS level, 
retaining only spectra that are not MS1 spectra (e.g.\ MS2, MS3 or MSn spectra):

.. code-block:: python
  :linenos:

  inp = MSExperiment()
  MzMLFile().load("test.mzML", inp)

  e = MSExperiment()
  for s in inp:
    if s.getMSLevel() > 1:
      e.addSpectrum(s)

  MzMLFile().store("test_filtered.mzML", e)


Filtering by scan number
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In a slightly more complex example we could use a list of scan numbers to filter by scan numbers,
thus only retaining MS scans in which we are interested in:

.. code-block:: python
  :linenos:

  inp = MSExperiment()
  MzMLFile().load("test.mzML", inp)
  scan_nrs = [0, 2, 5, 7]

  e = MSExperiment()
  for k, s in enumerate(inp):
    if k in scan_nrs and s.getMSLevel() == 1:
      e.addSpectrum(s)

  MzMLFile().store("test_filtered.mzML", e)

It would also be easy to read the scan numbers from a file where each scan
number is on its own line, thus replacing line 4 with:

.. code-block:: output
  :linenos:
  :lineno-start: 4

  scan_nrs = [int(k) for k in open("../scan_nrs.txt")]


Filtering Spectra and Peaks
***************************

We can now move on to more advanced filtering, suppose we are interested in
only a part of all fragment ion spectra, such as a specific m/z window.
We can easily filter our data accordingly:

.. code-block:: python
  :linenos:

  inp = MSExperiment()
  MzMLFile().load("test.mzML", inp)

  mz_start = 6.0
  mz_end = 12.0
  e = MSExperiment()
  for s in inp:
    if s.getMSLevel() > 1:
      filtered_mz = []
      filtered_int = []
      for mz, i in zip(*s.get_peaks()):
        if mz > mz_start and mz < mz_end:
          filtered_mz.append(mz)
          filtered_int.append(i)
      s.set_peaks((filtered_mz, filtered_int))
      e.addSpectrum(s)

  MzMLFile().store("test_filtered.mzML", e)

Note that in a real-world application, we would set the ``mz_start`` and
``mz_end`` parameter to an actual area of interest, for example the area
between 125 and 132 which contains quantitative ions for a TMT experiment.

Similarly we could change line 13 to only report peaks above a certain
intensity or to only report the top N peaks in a spectrum.
