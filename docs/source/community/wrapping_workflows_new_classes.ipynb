    "## How pyOpenMS Wraps C++ Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "General concept of how the wrapping is done (all files are in\n",
    "`src/pyOpenMS/`):\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Step 1: The author declares which C++ classes and which functions of\n",
    "    these classes she/he wants to wrap (expose to Python). This is done\n",
    "    by writing the class and function declaration in a `.pxd` file in\n",
    "    the `pxds/` folder.\n",
    "-   Step 2: The Python tool \"autowrap\" (developed for this project)\n",
    "    creates the wrapping code automatically from the function\n",
    "    declaration - see <https://github.com/OpenMS/autowrap> for an\n",
    "    explanation of the autowrap tool. Since not all code can be wrapped\n",
    "    automatically using the pxd file, manual Cython code sometimes need\n",
    "    to be written in the `addons/` folder. Autowrap will create an\n",
    "    output file at `pyopenms/pyopenms.pyx` which can be interpreted by\n",
    "    Cython.\n",
    "-   Step 3: Cython \"cythonizes\", i.e., translates the\n",
    "    `pyopenms/pyopenms.pyx` to C++ code at `pyopenms/pyopenms.cpp` that\n",
    "    contains everything to build a Python module.\n",
    "-   Step 4: A compiler, nowadays driven by CMake in OpenMS, compiles the\n",
    "    C++ code to a Python extension module (pyopenms.so/dylib/dll/pyd)\n",
    "    which is then importable in Python with `import pyopenms`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Maintaining existing wrappers\n",
    "\n",
    "If the C++ API is changed, then pyOpenMS will not build any more. Thus,\n",
    "find the corresponding file in the `pyOpenMS/pxds/` folder and adjust\n",
    "the function declaration accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Wrap New Methods in Existing Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets say you have written a new method for an existing OpenMS class and\n",
    "you would like to expose this method to pyOpenMS. First, identify the\n",
    "correct `.pxd` file in the `src/pyOpenMS/pxds` folder (for example for\n",
    "[Adduct](https://pyopenms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apidocs/_autosummary/pyopenms/pyopenms.Adduct.html)\n",
    "that would be\n",
    "[Adduct.pxd](https://github.com/OpenMS/OpenMS/blob/develop/src/pyOpenMS/pxds/Adduct.pxd)).\n",
    "Open it and add your new function *with the correct indentation*:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Place the full function declaration into the file (indented as the\n",
    "    other functions)\n",
    "-   Check whether you are using any classes that are not yet imported,\n",
    "    if so add a corresponding `cimport` statement to the top of the\n",
    "    file. E.g., if your method is using\n",
    "    [MSExperiment](https://pyopenms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apidocs/_autosummary/pyopenms/pyopenms.MSExperiment.html),\n",
    "    then add `from MSExperiment cimport *` to the top (note it's\n",
    "    `cimport`, not `import`).\n",
    "-   Most of the time it is clearer for a python user if you replace\n",
    "    const-references with values in the function signature because the\n",
    "    python function will always make a copy in that case. You should add\n",
    "    <span class=\"title-ref\">nogil except +</span> to the end of the\n",
    "    signature to indicate that it can be multithreaded and throw\n",
    "    exceptions.\n",
    "    -   Ex: `void setType(Int a);` becomes\n",
    "        `void setType(Int a) nogil except +`\n",
    "    -   Ex: `const T& getType() const;` becomes\n",
    "        `T getType() nogil except +`\n",
    "-   Remove any qualifiers (e.g. <span class=\"title-ref\">const</span>)\n",
    "    from the argument signatures, but leave reference and pointer\n",
    "    indicators\n",
    "    -   Ex: `const T&` becomes `T`, preventing an additional copy\n",
    "        operation\n",
    "    -   Ex: `T&` will stay `T&` (indicating `T` needs to copied back to\n",
    "        Python, make a note in the function docs that this argument may\n",

    "        Python, make a note in the function docs that this argument may\n",
    "        be changed)\n",
    "    -   One exception is `OpenMS::String`. You can leave `const String&`\n",
    "        as-is, since we have special handling for this.\n",
    "-   STL constructs are replaced with Cython constructs: `std::vector<X>`\n",
    "    becomes `libcpp_vector[ X ]` etc.\n",
    "-   Most complex STL constructs can be wrapped even if they are nested,\n",
    "    however mixing them with user-defined types does not always work,\n",
    "    see [Limitations](#Limitations) below. Nested `std::vector`\n",
    "    constructs work well even with user-defined (OpenMS-defined) types.\n",
    "    However, `std::map<String, X>` does not work (since `String` is\n",
    "    user-defined, however a primitive C++ type such as\n",
    "    `std::map<std::string, X>` would work).\n",
    "-   Python cannot pass primitive data types by reference (therefore no\n",
    "    `int& res1`)\n",
    "-   Python does not allow default values for parameters in C(++)\n",
    "    functions. Therefore you either accept the fact that the \"optional\"\n",
    "    value always needs to be specified in python or you wrap it twice,\n",
    "    once with and once without the optional parameter.\n",
    "-   Replace `boost::shared_ptr<X>` with `shared_ptr[X]` and add\n",
    "    `from smart_ptr cimport shared_ptr` to the top\n",
    "-   Public members are simply added with `Type member_name`. Private\n",
    "    ones should be left out.\n",
    "-   You can inject documentation that will be shown when calling\n",
    "    `help()` in the function by adding `wrap-doc:Your documentation` as\n",
    "    a comment after the function:\n",
    "    -   Ex:\n",
    "        `void modifyWidget() nogil except + # wrap-doc:This changes your widget`\n",
    "    -   Warning: For a single-line comment, there should not be a space\n",
