Build from Source
==================

To install pyOpenMS from :index:`source`, you will first have to compile OpenMS
successfully on your platform of choice (note that for MS Windows you will need
to match your compiler and Python version). Please follow the 
`official OpenMS documentation <https://openms.de/current_doxygen/>`_
in order to compile OpenMS for your platform. 

See https://github.com/OpenMS/OpenMS/tree/develop/src/pyOpenMS for installation instructions.
