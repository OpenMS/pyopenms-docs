Chromatographic Analysis
========================

In targeted :term:`proteomics`, such as :term:`SRM` / MRM / PRM / DIA applications, groups of
:term:`chromatograms` need to be analyzed frequently. OpenMS provides several powerful
tools for analysis of :term:`chromatograms`. Most of them are part of the OpenSWATH
suite of tools and are also discussed in the `OpenSwath documentation
<https://www.openswath.org>`_.

Peak Detection
**************

Here, we will focus on a simple example where two peptides are analyzed. We will
need 2 input files: the :term:`chromatogram` files that contains the chromatographic
raw data (raw :term:`SRM` traces or extracted ion :term:`chromatograms` from PRM/DIA data) as
well as the library file used to generated the data which contains information
about the targeted peptides:

.. code-block:: python

    from urllib.request import urlretrieve
    from pyopenms import *

    gh = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenMS/pyopenms-docs/master"
    urlretrieve(gh + "/src/data/OpenSwathAnalyzer_1_input_chrom.mzML", "chrom.mzML")
    urlretrieve(
        gh + "/src/data/OpenSwathAnalyzer_1_input.TraML", "transitions.TraML"
    )

    chroms = MSExperiment()
    library = TargetedExperiment()
    MzMLFile().load("chrom.mzML", chroms)
    TraMLFile().load("transitions.TraML", library)

    # Investigate library
    for t in library.getTransitions():
        print(
            "Transition",
            t.getNativeID(),
            "belongs to peptide group",
            t.getPeptideRef(),
        )

    print(
        "Input contains",
        len(library.getTransitions()),
        "transitions and",
        len(chroms.getChromatograms()),
        "chromatograms.",
    )
    features = FeatureMap()
    dummy_trafo = TransformationDescription()
    dummy_exp = MSExperiment()
    MRMFeatureFinderScoring().pickExperiment(
        chroms, features, library, dummy_trafo, dummy_exp
    )
    for f in features:
        print(
            "Feature for group",
            f.getMetaValue("PeptideRef"),
            "with precursor m/z",
            f.getMetaValue("PrecursorMZ"),
        )
        print(
            "  Feature found at RT =",
            f.getRT(),
            "with library dot product",
            f.getMetaValue("var_library_dotprod"),
        )

Here we see that for the first group of transitions (``tr_gr1``), a single peak
at retention time :math:`3119\ seconds` was found. However, for the second group of
transitions, two peaks are found at retention times :math:`3119\ seconds` and at
:math:`3055\ seconds`.

Visualization
*************

We can confirm the above analysis by visual inspection of the ``chrom.mzML``
file produced above in the :term:`TOPPView` software:

.. image:: img/chroms.png

However, our output above contains more information than only retention time:

.. code-block:: output

  Feature for group tr_gr1 with precursor m/z 500.0
    Feature found at RT = 3119.091968219877 with library dot product 0.9924204062692046
  Feature for group tr_gr2 with precursor m/z 501.0
    Feature found at RT = 3055.584481870532 with library dot product 0.952054383474221
  Feature for group tr_gr2 with precursor m/z 501.0
    Feature found at RT = 3119.0630105310684 with library dot product 0.7501676755451506  

Based on the output above, we can infer that the peak at :math:`3055\ seconds` is
likely the correct peak  for ``tr_gr2`` since it has a high library dot product
(:math:`0.95`) while the peak at :math:`3119\ seconds` is likely incorrect for ``tr_gr2`` since
its dot product is low (:math:`0.75`). We also see that a peak at :math:`3119\ seconds` is
likely correct for ``tr_gr1`` since it matches well with the expected library
intensities and has a high dot product (:math:`0.99`).

Note: to get an overview over all available scores for a particular MRM :term:`feature` ``f``, you can use

.. code-block:: python

    k = []
    f.getKeys(k)
    print(k)

.. TODO : change for 2.5 to something else


Smoothing
*********

Now you may want to show the :term:`chromatograms` to your collaborator, but you notice
that most software solutions smooth the :term:`chromatograms` before display. In order
to provide smooth :term:`chromatograms`, you can apply a filter using :term:`pyOpenMS`:

.. code-block:: python

    sg = SavitzkyGolayFilter()
    sg.filterExperiment(chroms)
    # MzMLFile().store("chrom.filter.mzML", chroms)


Which leads to the following smoothed chromatographic traces:
