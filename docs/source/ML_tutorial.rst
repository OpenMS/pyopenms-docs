Interfacing with ML libraries
=============================

Overview
--------

Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without 
being explicitly programmed. Machine learning (ML) is well known for its powerful ability to recognize 
patterns and signals. Recently, the mass spectrometry community has embraced ML techniques for large-scale data analysis.

Predicting accurate retention times has shown to improve identification in bottom-up proteomics.

In this tutorial we will predict the retention time from amino acid sequence data using simple machine learning methods.

First, we import all neccessary libraries for this tutorial.

.. code-block:: python

    !pip install seaborn
    !pip install xgboost

.. code-block:: python

    import pandas as pd
    import seaborn as sns
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import string
    from collections import Counter
    import numpy as np
    from urllib.request import urlretrieve

Once we have imported all libraries successfully, we are going to store the dataset in a variable.

.. code-block:: python

    gh = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenMS/pyopenms-docs/master"
    urlretrieve (gh + "/src/data/pyOpenMS_ML_Tutorial.tsv", "data.tsv")
    tsv_data = pd.read_csv('data.tsv', sep='\t', skiprows=17)

Here we have prepared a tsv file that contains three columns **sequence** , **charge** and **retention** time.
Note that this table could also be easily created from identification data as produced in previous chapters.

Before we move forward lets try to understand more about our data:

a. Sequence - Chains of amino acids form peptides or proteins. The arrangement of amino acids is reffered as amino acid sequence. The composition and order of amino acids affect the physicochemical properties of the peptide and lead to different retention in the column.
b. Retention time (RT) - is the time taken for an analyte to pass through a chromatography column.

From the amino acid sequence we can derive additional properties (machine learning features) used to train our machine learning model.

We can easily check for its shape by using the tsv_data.shape attribute, 
which will return the size of the dataset.

.. code-block:: python

    print(tsv_data.shape)

.. code-block:: output

    (15896, 3)

Explore the top 5 rows of the dataset by using head() method on pandas DataFrame.

.. code-block:: python

    tsv_data.head()

.. code-block:: output

        sequence	    RT	        charge
    0	EEETVAK	            399.677766	2
    1	EQEEQQQQEGHNNK	    624.555300	3
    2	SHGGHTVISK	    625.797960	3
    3	SGTHNMYK	    625.982520	2
    4	AARPTRPDK	    626.073300	3

As the RT column is our response variable, we will be storing it seperately as Y1_test

.. code-block:: python

    Y1_test = tsv_data["RT"]

Preprocessing
-------------

Cleaning data before applying a machine learning method keeps the relevant 
information in potentially massive amount of data. 

Here we will apply some simple preprocessing to extract novel machine learning features from the amino acid 
sequences. Some of the parameters that can be derived are

1. {Alphabet}_count = The count of Amino Acids in the sequence.
2. {Alphabet}_freq = The count of Amino Acids divided by the total length of the sequence.
3. length = The total number of amino acids in the sequence.

.. code-block:: python

    alphabet_list = list(string.ascii_uppercase)
    column_headers = ["sequence"] + [ i + "_count" for i in alphabet_list] + [ i + "_freq" for i in alphabet_list] + ["charge", "length"]
    types = ["object"] + [ "int64" for i in alphabet_list] + [ "float64" for i in alphabet_list] + ["int64", "int64"]
    pdcols = dict(zip(column_headers, types))

As we have all the column names, now we will start populating it.

.. code-block:: python

    df = pd.DataFrame(np.zeros((len(tsv_data.index), len(column_headers))), columns = column_headers)

    df["sequence"] = tsv_data["sequence"]
    df["charge"] = tsv_data["charge"]

    # For populating the length column
    df['length'] = df['sequence'].str.len() 

    df = df.astype( dtype = pdcols)

    # For populating the {alphabet}_count columns
    def count(row):
        counts = Counter(row["sequence"])
        for count in counts:
            row[count+"_count"] = int(counts[count])
        return row
        
    df = df.apply(lambda row: count(row), axis = 1)
    df.head()

.. code-block:: output

    sequence	        A_count	B_count	C_count	D_count	E_count	F_count	G_count	H_count	I_count	...	    S_freq	T_freq	U_freq	V_freq	W_freq	X_freq	Y_freq	Z_freq	charge	length

    2	SHGGHTVISK	    0	    0	    0	    0	    0	    0	    2	    2	    1	    ...	    0.0         0.0	    0.0	    0.0	    0.0	    0.0	    0.0	    0.0	    3	    10
    3	SGTHNMYK	    0	    0	    0	    0	    0	    0	    1	    1	    0	    ...	    0.0	        0.0	    0.0	    0.0	    0.0	    0.0	    0.0	    0.0	    2	    8
    4	AARPTRPDK	    2	    0	    0	    1	    0	    0	    0	    0	    0	    ...	    0.0	        0.0	    0.0	    0.0	    0.0	    0.0	    0.0	    0.0	    3	    9

Now we have completed all the data preprocessing steps. We have deduced a good amount of information from the amino acid sequences
that might have influence on the retention time in the column.

Now we are good to proceed on building the machine learning model.

Modelling
---------

.. code-block:: python

    import seaborn as sns
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold
    from xgboost import XGBRegressor
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from matplotlib import pyplot
    from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
    from sklearn.model_selection import ShuffleSplit

.. code-block:: python

    test_df = df.copy()
    test_df = test_df.drop("sequence", axis=1)

Now, we create the train and test set for cross-validation of the results 
using the ``train_test_split`` function from sklearn's model_selection module with test_size 
size equal to 30% of the data. Also, to maintain reproducibility of the results, a random_state is also assigned.

.. code-block:: python

    # Splitting Test data into test and validation
    X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(test_df, Y1_test, test_size = 0.3, random_state = 3)

We will be using the ``XGBRegressor()`` class because it is clearly a regression problem as the response variable ( retention time ) is continuous.

.. code-block:: python

    xg_reg = XGBRegressor(n_estimators = 300, random_state = 3, max_leaves = 5, colsample_bytree = 0.7, max_depth = 7)

Fit the regressor to the training set and make predictions on the test set using the familiar .fit() and .predict() methods.

.. code-block:: python

    xg_reg.fit(X_train, Y_train)
    Y_pred = xg_reg.predict(X_test)

Compute the root mean square error (rmse) using the mean_sqaured_error function from sklearn's metrics module.

.. code-block:: python

    rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(Y_test, Y_pred))
    print("RMSE: %f" % (rmse))

.. code-block:: output

    RMSE: 437.017290

Store the **Observed** v/s **Predicted** value in pandas dataframe and print.

.. code-block:: python

    k = pd.DataFrame({'Observed': Y_test.values.flatten(), 'Predicted': Y_pred.flatten()})
    print(k)

.. code-block:: output

                Observed	Predicted
    0	        3652.28442	3927.141846
    1	        4244.80320	4290.294434
    2	        3065.19054	3703.156982
    3	        909.50610	762.218567
    4	        1982.80902	2628.958740
    ...	        ...	...
    4764	5527.23804	5599.530762
    4765	3388.76430	3272.557617
    4766	3101.35566	3346.364990
    4767	5515.94682	5491.597168
    4768	2257.63092	2258.312988

We will now generate a **Observed** v/s **Predicted** plot that gives a high level overview about the model performance. 
We can clearly see that only few outliers are there and most of them lie in between the central axis.
This means that prediction actually worked and observed and predicted value won't differ too much.

.. code-block:: python

    sns.lmplot(x="Observed", y="Predicted", data=k, scatter_kws={'alpha':0.2,'s':5})

.. image:: img/ml_tutorial_predicted_vs_observed.png

.. code-block:: python

    p = sns.kdeplot(data=k["Observed"]-k["Predicted"], fill=True)
    p.set(xlabel = "Observed-Predicted (s)")

.. image:: img/ml_tutorial_kdplot.png
    
In order to build more robust models, it is common to do a k-fold cross validation where all the entries in the original training dataset are 
used for both training as well as validation. Also, each entry is used for validation just once. XGBoost supports 
k-fold cross validation via the cv() method. All we have to do is specify the nfolds parameter, which is the number of cross validation sets we want to build.

.. code-block:: python

    # Performing k-fold cross validation
    X = np.arange(10)
    ss = ShuffleSplit(n_splits=5, test_size=0.25, random_state=0)
    performance_df = pd.DataFrame()
    performance_list = []
    counter = 0
    for train_index, test_index in ss.split(X_train, Y_train):

        counter += 1
        
        X_train_Kfold, X_test_Kfold = X_train[X_train.index.isin(train_index)].to_numpy(), X_train[X_train.index.isin(test_index)].to_numpy()
        y_train_Kfold, y_test_Kfold = Y_train[Y_train.index.isin(train_index)].to_numpy().flatten(), Y_train[Y_train.index.isin(test_index)].to_numpy().flatten()

        Regressor = XGBRegressor()
        Regressor.fit(X_train_Kfold, y_train_Kfold)
        
        predictions = Regressor.predict(X_test_Kfold)
        
        df = pd.DataFrame({'Observed': y_test_Kfold.flatten(), 'Predicted': predictions.flatten()})
        
        print("Fold-" + str(counter))
        print("---------------------")
        print(df)

That's it, we trained a simple machine learning model to predict peptide retention times from peptide data.

Sophisticated machine models integrate retention time data from many experiments add additional properties 
(or even learn them from data) of peptides to achieve lower prediction errors.
