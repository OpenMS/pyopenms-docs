Peptide Search 
=============

In MS-based proteomics, fragment ion spectra (MS2 spectra) are often
interpreted by comparing them against a theoretical set of spectra generated
from a FASTA database. OpenMS contains a (simple) implementation of such a
"search engine" that compares experimental spectra against theoretical spectra
generated from an enzymatic or chemical digest of a proteome (e.g. tryptic
digest). 

SimpleSearch
************

In most proteomics applications, a dedicated search engine (such as Comet,
Crux, Mascot, MSGFPlus, MSFragger, Myrimatch, OMSSA, SpectraST or XTandem;
all of which are supported by pyOpenMS) will be used to search data. Here, we will
use the internal ``SimpleSearchEngineAlgorithm`` from OpenMS used for teaching
purposes. This makes it very easy to search an (experimental) mzML file against
a fasta database of protein sequences:

.. code-block:: python

    from urllib.request import urlretrieve
    # from urllib import urlretrieve  # use this code for Python 2.x
    from pyopenms import *
    gh = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenMS/OpenMS/develop"
    urlretrieve (gh +"/src/tests/topp/SimpleSearchEngine_1.mzML", "searchfile.mzML")
    urlretrieve (gh +"/src/tests/topp/SimpleSearchEngine_1.fasta", "search.fasta")
    protein_ids = []
    peptide_ids = []
    SimpleSearchEngineAlgorithm().search("searchfile.mzML", "search.fasta", protein_ids, peptide_ids) 

This will print search engine output including the number of peptides and
proteins in the database and how many spectra were matched to peptides and
proteins:

.. code-block:: python

    Peptide statistics
    
      unmatched                : 0 (0 %)
      target/decoy:
        match to target DB only: 2 (100 %)
        match to decoy DB only : 0 (0 %)
        match to both          : 0 (0 %)
    

PSM inspection
**************

We can now investigate the individual hits as we have done before in the
`Identification tutorial <datastructures_id.html#peptideidentification>`_.

.. code-block:: python

    for peptide_id in peptide_ids:
      # Peptide identification values
      print (35*"=")
      print ("Peptide ID m/z:", peptide_id.getMZ())
      print ("Peptide ID rt:", peptide_id.getRT())
      print ("Peptide scan index:", peptide_id.getMetaValue("scan_index"))
      print ("Peptide scan name:", peptide_id.getMetaValue("scan_index"))
      print ("Peptide ID score type:", peptide_id.getScoreType())
      # PeptideHits
      for hit in peptide_id.getHits():
        print(" - Peptide hit rank:", hit.getRank())
        print(" - Peptide hit charge:", hit.getCharge())
        print(" - Peptide hit sequence:", hit.getSequence())
        mz = hit.getSequence().getMonoWeight(Residue.ResidueType.Full, hit.getCharge()) / hit.getCharge()
        print(" - Peptide hit monoisotopic m/z:", mz) 
        print(" - Peptide ppm error:", abs(mz - peptide_id.getMZ())/mz *10**6 )
        print(" - Peptide hit score:", hit.getScore())


We notice that the second peptide spectrum match (PSM) was found for the third
spectrum in the file for a precursor at 775.38 m/z for the sequence
``RPGADSDIGGFGGLFDLAQAGFR``.  

.. code-block:: python

    tsg = TheoreticalSpectrumGenerator()
    thspec = MSSpectrum()
    p = Param()
    p.setValue("add_metainfo", "true")
    tsg.setParameters(p)
    peptide = AASequence.fromString("RPGADSDIGGFGGLFDLAQAGFR")
    tsg.getSpectrum(thspec, peptide, 1, 1)
    # Iterate over annotated ions and their masses
    for ion, peak in zip(thspec.getStringDataArrays()[0], thspec):
        print(ion, peak.getMZ())

    e = MSExperiment()
    MzMLFile().load("searchfile.mzML", e)
    print ("Spectrum native id", e[2].getNativeID() )
    mz,i = e[2].get_peaks()
    peaks = [(mz,i) for mz,i in zip(mz,i) if i > 1500 and mz > 300]
    for peak in peaks:
      print (peak[0], "mz", peak[1], "int")

Comparing the theoretical spectrum and the experimental spectrum for
``RPGADSDIGGFGGLFDLAQAGFR`` we can easily see that the most abundant ions in the
spectrum are y8 (877.452 m/z), b10 (926.432), y9 (1024.522 m/z) and b13
(1187.544 m/z).

Visualization
*************

When loading the ``searchfile.mzML`` into the OpenMS
visualization software TOPPView, we can convince ourselves that the observed
spectrum indeed was generated by the peptide ``RPGADSDIGGFGGLFDLAQAGFR`` by loading
the corresponding theoretical spectrum into the viewer using "Tools"->"Generate
theoretical spectrum":

.. image:: img/psm.png

From our output above, we notice that the second peptide spectrum match (PSM)
at 775.38 m/z for sequence ``RPGADSDIGGFGGLFDLAQAGFR`` was found with an error
tolerance of 2.25 ppm, therefore if we set the precursor mass tolerance to 4
ppm (+/- 2ppm), we expect that we will not find the hit at 775.38 m/z any more:

.. code-block:: python

    salgo = SimpleSearchEngineAlgorithm()
    p = salgo.getDefaults()
    print ( p.items() )
    p[b'precursor:mass_tolerance'] = 4.0
    salgo.setParameters(p)

    protein_ids = []
    peptide_ids = []
    salgo.search("searchfile.mzML", "search.fasta", protein_ids, peptide_ids) 
    print("Found", len(peptide_ids), "peptides")

As we can see, using a smaller precursor mass tolerance leads the algorithm to
find only one hit instead of two. Similarly, if we use the wrong enzyme for
the digestion (e.g. ``p[b'enzyme'] = "Formic_acid"``), we find no results.

More detailed example
*********************

Now include some additional decoy database generation step as well as subsequent FDR filtering.

.. code-block:: python

    from urllib.request import urlretrieve
    # from urllib import urlretrieve  # use this code for Python 2.x
    from pyopenms import *
    searchfile = "../../data/BSA1.mzML"
    searchdb = "../../data/18Protein_SoCe_Tr_detergents_trace.fasta"

    # generate a protein database with additional decoy sequenes
    targets = list()
    decoys = list()
    FASTAFile().load(searchdb, targets) # read FASTA file into a list of FASTAEntrys
    decoy_generator = DecoyGenerator()
    for entry in targets:
        rev_entry = FASTAEntry(entry) # copy entry
        rev_entry.identifier = "DECOY_" + rev_entry.identifier # mark as decoy
        aas = AASequence().fromString(rev_entry.sequence) # convert string into amino acid sequence
        rev_entry.sequence = decoy_generator.reverseProtein(aas).toString() # reverse
        decoys.append(rev_entry)

    target_decoy_database = "search_td.fasta"
    FASTAFile().store(target_decoy_database, targets + decoys) # store the database with appended decoy sequences

    # Run SimpleSearchAlgorithm, store protein and peptide ids
    protein_ids = []
    peptide_ids = []

    # set some custom search parameters
    simplesearch = SimpleSearchEngineAlgorithm()
    params = simplesearch.getDefaults()
    score_annot = [b'fragment_mz_error_median_ppm', b'precursor_mz_error_ppm']
    params.setValue(b'annotate:PSM', score_annot)
    params.setValue(b'peptide:max_size', 30)
    simplesearch.setParameters(params)

    simplesearch.search(searchfile, target_decoy_database, protein_ids, peptide_ids)

    # Annotate q-value
    FalseDiscoveryRate().apply(peptide_ids)

    # Filter by 1% PSM FDR (q-value < 0.01)
    idfilter = IDFilter()
    idfilter.filterHitsByScore(peptide_ids, 0.01)
    idfilter.removeDecoyHits(peptide_ids)

    # store PSM-FDR filtered 
    IdXMLFile().store("searchfile_results_1perc_FDR.idXML", protein_ids, peptide_ids)

However, usually researchers are interested in the most confidently identified proteins.
This so called *protein inference* problem is a difficult problem because of often occurring shared/ambiguous peptides.
To be able to calculate a target/decoy-based FDR on the protein level,
we need to assign scores to proteins first (e.g. based on their observed peptides).
This is done by applying one of the available protein inference algorithms on the peptide and protein IDs.

.. code-block:: python

    protein_ids = []
    peptide_ids = []

    # Re-run search since we need to keep decoy hits for inference
    simplesearch.search(searchfile, target_decoy_database, protein_ids, peptide_ids)

    # Run inference
    BasicProteinInferenceAlgorithm().run(peptide_ids, protein_ids)

    # Annotate q-value on protein level
    FalseDiscoveryRate().apply(protein_ids)

    # Filter by 1% protein FDR (q-value < 0.01)
    idfilter = IDFilter()
    idfilter.filterHitsByScore(protein_ids, 0.01)
    idfilter.removeDecoyHits(protein_ids)
    # Restore valid references into the proteins
    remove_peptides_without_reference = True
    idfilter.updateProteinReferences(peptide_ids, protein_ids, remove_peptides_without_reference)

    # store protein-FDR filtered 
    IdXMLFile().store("searchfile_results_1perc_protFDR.idXML", protein_ids, peptide_ids)
