Installation
============


Try online
----------

You can try out :term:`pyOpenMS` in your browser. Just navigate to a topic you are interested in
by clicking in the menu bar. Then click on the "Try online with Binder" button.

Note that the first start of binder might take a bit. While binder is perfect
for trying :term:`pyOpenMS` it only offers a limited amount of memory. You should install
the :term:`pyOpenMS` binaries on your PC for serious data processing.

We recommend to use :term:`pyOpenMS` in PyCharm as it works well with source code documentation.

Command Line
------------

To :index:`install` :term:`pyOpenMS` from the command line using the binary wheels, you
can type

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install numpy
  pip install pyopenms


We have binary packages for OSX, Linux and Windows (64 bit only) available from
`PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/pyopenms>`_. Make sure to download
the 64bit Python release for Windows. Currently we only support
Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9.

You can install Python first from `here <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_,
again make sure to download the 64bit release. You can then open a shell and
type the two commands above (on Windows you may potentially have to use
``C:\Python37\Scripts\pip.exe`` in case ``pip`` is not in your system path).

Nightly/ CI wheels
------------------

If you want the newest features you can also install nightly builds of :term:`pyOpenMS`.

You can either directly download the latest nightly build by executing the commands below.

.. code-block:: bash

  MY_OS="Linux" # or "macOS" or "Windows" (case-sensitive)
  wget https://nightly.link/OpenMS/OpenMS/workflows/pyopenms-wheels/nightly/${MY_OS}-wheels.zip\?status\=completed
  mv ${MY_OS}-wheels.zip\?status=completed ${MY_OS}-wheels.zip
  
Or manually visit the GitHub page that contains the action to build the nightly wheels: https://github.com/OpenMS/OpenMS/actions/workflows/pyopenms-wheels.yml,
click on e.g., the newest nightly build on the top to get access to artefacts and download the corresponding wheel for macOS, Linux, or Windows.

.. image:: img/githubActionWheels.png

Now, unzip the folder and select the supported Python version for your environment.
The supported Python version is denoted as ``cp3X`` in the wheel file name
(e.g. pyopenms_nightly-2.7.0.dev20220111-cp39-cp39-macosx_10_9_x86_64 for python 3.9 and macOS >= 10.9)

Finally, install the package with the following shell command:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install your-compatible.whl --no-cache-dir

Note that the Github Action page may contain unstable builds and different operating systems might
be in a different state (they even might not be available if the builds for a specific OS did not succeed in a long time).


Source (advanced users)
-----------------------

To install :term:`pyOpenMS` from :index:`source`, you will first have to compile OpenMS
successfully on your platform of choice and then follow the `building from
source <build_from_source.html>`_ instructions. Note that this may be
non-trivial and *is not recommended* for most users.

Wrap Classes (advanced users)
-----------------------------

In order to wrap new classes in :term:`pyOpenMS`, read the following `guide
<wrap_classes.html>`_.
