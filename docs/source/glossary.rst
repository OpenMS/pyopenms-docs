    TOPP tools
        OpenMS provides a number of functions that process MS data called :term:`TOPP` tools. All :term:`TOPP`
        tools are described in the `OpenMS API reference documentation <https://abibuilder.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/archive/openms/Documentation/nightly/html/TOPP_documentation.html>`__.

    UTILS
        Besides :term:`TOPP tools`, OpenMS offers a range of other tools. They are not included in :term:`TOPP` as they
        are not part of typical analysis pipelines. More information is present in `OpenMS API reference documentation <https://abibuilder.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/archive/openms/Documentation/nightly/html/UTILS_documentation.html>`__.

    TOPPView
        TOPPView is a viewer for MS and HPLC-MS data.

        Untested installers and containers are known as the nightly snapshot.

    MascotAdapter
        Used to identifies peptides in MS2 spectra. Read more about MascotAdapter in the `OpenMS API reference documentation <https://abibuilder.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/archive/openms/Documentation/nightly/html/TOPP_MascotAdapter.html>`__.

    high performance liquid chromatography
    HPLC
        In high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), analytes are dissolved in a pressurized solvent (mobile phase)
        and pumped through a solid adsorbent material (stationary phase) packed into a
        capillary column. Physicochemical properties of the analyte determine how strongly it
        interacts with the stationary phase.

    mzML
    mzml
        The mzML format is an open, XML-based format for mass spectrometer output files, developed with the full participation
        of vendors and researchers in order to create a single open format that would be supported by all software.

    mzData
    mzdata
        mzData was the first attempt by the Proteomics Standards Initiative (PSI) from the Human Proteome Organization (HUPO)
        to create a standardized format for MS data. This format is now deprecated, and replaced by mzML.

        mzXML is an open data format for storage and exchange of mass spectroscopy data, developed at the SPC/Institute for
        Systems Biology.

    feature maps
    feature map
        A feature map is a collection of features identified in a mass spectrum from a single experiment.
        One feature map can contain many features. OpenMS represents a feature map using the class `FeatureMap <https://abibuilder.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/archive/openms/Documentation/nightly/html/classOpenMS_1_1FeatureMap.html>`_.

    consensus features
    consensus feature
        Features from replicate experiments with similar retention times and m/z values are linked and considered a consensus feature.
        A consensus feature contains information on the common retention time and m/z values as well as intensities for each sample.

    consensus maps
    consensus map
        A consensus map is a collection of :term:`consensus features` identified from mass spectra across replicate experiments.
        One consensus map can contain many consensus features. OpenMS represents a consensus map using the class `ConsensusMap <https://abibuilder.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/archive/openms/Documentation/nightly/html/classOpenMS_1_1ConsensusMap.html>`_.
