## pyOpenMS Extra

=============

pyOpenMS are the Python bindings to the OpenMS open-source C++ library for
LC-MS data management and analyses. The Python bindings cover a large part of
the OpenMS API to enable rapid algorithm development and workflow development.
pyOpenMS supports the Proteomics Standard Initiative (PSI) formats for MS data.

These utils contain documentation, installation instructions and example code
that show the different functions of pyOpenMS.

## Installation

Installation is best done through [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyopenms)
(the Python package index) where binary packages are provided for the release
versions of OpenMS, covering Linux/Mac/Windows.

## Documentation
